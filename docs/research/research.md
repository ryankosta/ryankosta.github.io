# Research
I am currently researching at UC San Diego co-advised by Prof. Yiying Zhang ([Wuklab](https://wuklab.io)) and Prof. Amy Ousterhout. 

In general, I am interested in innovating computer hardware and operating systems, and all that lies in between.
## Research Interests
- Operating Systems
- Datacenter Networks
- Computer Architecture 
- File Systems
