## Who am I

Hello! I'm Ryan Kosta, an incoming PhD student at UC San Diego, studying Computer Science.

I am advised by [Amy Ousterhout](https://amyousterhout.com/) and [Alex Snoeren](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~snoeren/)

During my undergrad (also at UCSD) I was advised by [Yiying Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~yiying/) and [Amy Ousterhout](https://amyousterhout.com/).

I also recently completed a summer research internship at EPFL with [Edouard Bugnion](https://people.epfl.ch/edouard.bugnion) (Co-founder of VMware and Nuova systems)

### What I do 

My research interests span Operating Systems, Datacenter Networks, and Computer Architecture.

In my free time I like learning languages, exploring, and occasionally playing guitar or videogames

### Contact

Always excited to discuss research with those in industry, academia, or who are interested!

Definitely reach out: **rkosta** AT **ucsd.edu**
